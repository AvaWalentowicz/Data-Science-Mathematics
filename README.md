# Data-Science-Mathematics (Module 1)

This github repo will contain all the materials for the Analytics Training Sessions. Please take some time to get familir with the layout of this repo. You will need to create your own personal github repo. Github will be ideal for sharing work and keeping sessions organized. We want to keep our workflow as self contained as possible. (Independent of sending attached documents)
